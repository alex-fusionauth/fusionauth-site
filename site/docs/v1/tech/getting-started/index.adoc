== Overview

FusionAuth is a modern platform for Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM). FusionAuth provides APIs and a responsive web user interface to support login, registration, localized email, multi-factor authentication, reporting and much more.

If you're looking for employee login or a replacement for Active Directory, you may be in the wrong place. While FusionAuth can be used for nearly any application, we do not offer native desktop integration and replacing Active Directory is not on our roadmap.

If you're looking for a solution to manage end users that can perform at scale, then keep reading.

== Your App: Before and After

Here's a typical user login flow before FusionAuth. Though this references web pages, this flow is technology agnostic and could be in a mobile app, web app or single page application (SPA) written in any language.

== Why Use an Identity As a Service Provider

FusionAuth is an Identity as a Service provider (IDaaS). Why would you consider using a service like FusionAuth to store and manage your user data?

== Adding Functionality

How do you actually integrate FusionAuth with your appliation? Let's walk through three common pieces of functionality: login (also known as 'sign in'), logout (also known as 'sign out') and registration (also known as 'sign up').

//If you want step by step detailed instructions, please visit our quickstarts page.

=== Login

To add login, you need to:

1. link:/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/[Install FusionAuth locally] or use a cloud deployment (there's a link:/pricing?step=plan&hosting=basic-cloud[free trial]).
1. Select an OIDC or OAuth2 client library for your application and install it. Here's a https://oauth.net/code/[list of client libraries].
1. Create an Application in FusionAuth representing your mobile app, web app or API. Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Applications -> Your Application -> OAuth#.
 * Configure the redirect URL. The exact value depends on the OIDC client library you use. It'll may be called a redirect URI.
 * Check the [uielement]#Authorization Code# in the [field]#Enabled grants# section.
 * Save the Application.
 * Edit it again and note the following:
   * The [field]#Client Id#
   * The [field]#Client Secret#
1. Configure the OIDC client library with the Id and Secret.
 * If using an OAuth2 client library, ensure you set the scope to `openid`.
1. Add a login link to your application. When clicked or tapped, it will send the user to FusionAuth. The OIDC library may provide that.

Here's an example of the Application [breadcrumb]#OAuth# tab.

That's it. After the user successfully logs in to FusionAuth, the client library will store the user information for you.

=== Logout

To add logout, you need to:

1. 


=== Registration

== Core Concepts

Legacy identity technologies have complex hierarchy and cryptic terminology like realms, principals, subjects and distinguished names. In order to simplify something perceived to be complex, the best approach is to go back to the basics, to the atomic elements and throw everything else away.

When we built FusionAuth we took the back to basics approach. We identified two atomic elements of identify, Users and Applications. Everyone has Users, and Users need to be authenticated to Applications.

FusionAuth is built upon four core elements:

* Users - someone that can log into things
* Applications - the things that Users log in to
* Registrations - a connection between a User and an Application to which they have access
* Tenants - a container logically isolating Applications, Users and Registrations

=== Users

A user is uniquely identified in any particular tenant by an email address or username. link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/users[Learn more.]

=== Applications

A FusionAuth Application represents an authenticated resource such as a web application, mobile application or any other application that requires authenticated users. A FusionAuth Application is defined by a name and a set of Roles. link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/applications[Learn more.]

=== Registrations

A User can be registered to one or more FusionAuth Applications. A User Registration can define one to many Application Roles. link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/registrations[Learn more.]

=== Tenants

Tenants are way to separate Users, Applications and Registrations into separate containers. Inside a Tenant, you can define any number of Users, Applications and Registrations. Across Tenants, you can define duplicate Applications, Users and Registrations.

For example, you might have two Tenants and inside both Tenants you might have an Application named `Web Based Payroll` and a User with the email address `john@piedpiper.com`. Each of these Users might have a Registration to the `Web Based Payroll` Application. And finally, each of these Users might have different passwords and data. link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/tenants[Learn more.]

Now that you've seen how to add login, logout and registration to your application, as well as learned core concepts, dig deeper into the documentation.
